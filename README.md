# cordova-opencv
OpenCV plugin to Cordova

Starting with iOS, we are building a generic plugin for cordova to use OpenCV.  This will open up the ability for non-technical people to access all manner of image processing and object tracking to create unique experiences - 'Augmenting Reality'.

First code submission coming soon - contact us, or leave a message if you want to know more or get involved.
